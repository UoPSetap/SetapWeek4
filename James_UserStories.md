## Scenario D: PC Part Search Tool

*“The system will provide the user with the ability to search for and compare PC components.” The target audience for this system is senior citizens with specific budgets and limited IT experience. The motivation for building this system is to provide end users with an easy to learn interface for identifying, comparing, and purchasing PC components.  (Team 4B, 2019)* 

**Question: What are the most important things you look for when purchasing PC components, such as specific parts or just looking for performance? How would you like these compared?**

- **Browsing:** Not looking for specific items due to lack of knowledge, prefers to browse over everything

- **Opinions and Reviews:** Values other buyer's feedback, due to lack of knowledge they would look to others for clarification

- **Sharing capabilities:** Family opinion is important, therefore it's important to be able to easily share links to them to them
