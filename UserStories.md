## Scenario D: PC Part Search Tool

*“The system will provide the user with the ability to search for and compare PC components.” The target audience for this system is senior citizens with specific budgets and limited IT experience. The motivation for building this system is to provide end users with an easy to learn interface for identifying, comparing, and purchasing PC components.  (Team 4B, 2019)* 

**Question: What kind of support would you like to have when choosing PC components?**

- **Visual Aids:** Provide clear and comprehensive diagrams illustrating the placement of each component within the computer system. This visual representation will assist users in understanding the physical layout and connections of the components.

- **Component Descriptions:** Offer detailed descriptions of each component's function and purpose within the computer system. These descriptions should be written in plain language, avoiding technical jargon, to ensure comprehension for users with limited IT knowledge.

- **Price Sensitivity:** Prioritize affordability by prominently displaying the most cost-effective components. This emphasis on price consciousness aligns with the target audience's budget constraints.

- **Compatibility Verification:** Implement a compatibility checker to ensure that the selected components are compatible with the user's existing computer system. This verification process eliminates potential compatibility issues and builds confidence in the user's purchasing decisions.

- **Installation Assistance:** Provide comprehensive installation instructions or offer an optional installation service. This support caters to users who may lack the technical expertise to install components independently.
